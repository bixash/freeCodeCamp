            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 
                Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for 
                scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
            </p>

            <h2>Why to use python?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <P> If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. 
                    For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename 
                    and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, 
                    or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</P>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual 
                    write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code 
                    a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written 
                    a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and 
                    implement a whole new language for your application.</p>
                </li>
                
                
                    <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter 
                    than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <p>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</p></li>

                        <li><p>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</p></li>

                        <li><p>o variable or argument declarations are necessary.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

        <section class="main-section" id="numbers">

            <h2>Numbers</h2>
                <p>
                    The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. 
                    Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages 
                    (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
                </p>

            <code>>>> 2 + 2
                4
                >>> 50 - 5*6
                20
                >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
                5.0
                >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
                1.6
            </code>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="strings">

            <h2>Strings</h2>

        <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, 
            which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in 
            single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to escape quotes:
            </p> 
            <code>>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
                'spam eggs'
                >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
                "doesn't"
                >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
                "doesn't"
                >>> '"Yes," they said.'
                '"Yes," they said.'
                >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
                '"Yes," they said.'
                >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
                '"Isn\'t," they said.'
            </code>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="lists">
            <h2>Lists</h2>
            <P>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, 
            which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, 
            but usually the items all have the same type.
            </P>

            <code>>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
                >>> squares
                [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


                
            </code>
            <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>
            <code>>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
                1
                >>> squares[-1]
                25
                >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
                [9, 16, 25]
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="if_statements">

            <h2>if Statements</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>

            <code>>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                Please enter an integer: 42
                >>> if x < 0:
                ...     x = 0
                ...     print('Negative changed to zero')
                ... elif x == 0:
                ...     print('Zero')
                ... elif x == 1:
                ...     print('Single')
                ... else:
                ...     print('More')
                ...
                More
            </code>
            <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, 
                and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. 
                An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
                </p> 
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="for_statements">
            <h2>for Statements</h2>

            <p> 
                The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. 
                Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user 
                the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of 
                any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended): </p>

                <code>>>> # Measure some strings:
                    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
                    >>> for w in words:
                    ...     print(w, len(w))
                    ...
                    cat 3
                    window 6
                    defenestrate 12
                </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_range">

            <h2>The range() Function</h2>
            <p>If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. 
                It generates arithmetic progressions:
            </p>
            <code>>>> for i in range(5):
                ...     print(i)
                ...
                0
                1
                2
                3
                4
            </code>

            <p>The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence 
            of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes 
            this is called the ‘step’):</p>

            <code>range(5, 10)
                5, 6, 7, 8, 9

                range(0, 10, 3)
                0, 3, 6, 9

                range(-10, -100, -30)
                -10, -40, -70
            </code>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="break_statements">
            <h2>Break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops</h2>
            <p>The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.</p>

            <p>Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the iterable (with for) or 
            when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement. 
            This is exemplified by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:
            </p>
            <code>>>> for n in range(2, 10):
                ...     for x in range(2, n):
                ...         if n % x == 0:
                ...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
                ...             break
                ...     else:
                ...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
                ...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
                ...
                2 is a prime number
                3 is a prime number
                4 equals 2 * 2
                5 is a prime number
                6 equals 2 * 3
                7 is a prime number
                8 equals 2 * 4
                9 equals 3 * 3
            </code>
            
            <p>(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.)

            When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does with that of 
            if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, 
            and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.

        <section class="main-section" id="pass_statements">

            <h2>pass statements</h2>
            <p>  The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. 
                For example:
            </p>  

            <code>>>> while True:
                ...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)

        <section class="main-section" id="defining_function ">
            <h2>Defining functions</h2>
            <p>We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:

            </p>

            <code>>>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
                ...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
                ...     a, b = 0, 1
                ...     while a < n:
                ...         print(a, end=' ')
                ...         a, b = b, a+b
                ...     print()
                ...
                >>> # Now call the function we just defined:
                ... fib(2000)
                0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597
            </code>

            <p>The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. 
            The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.

            The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, 
            or docstring. (More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings.) There are tools which use docstrings to 
            automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; 
            it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.
